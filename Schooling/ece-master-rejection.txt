After careful evaluation of your application, the M.S. Review Committee regrets to inform you that your application for the M.S. program in Electrical Engineering was denied. Admission is highly selective and we cannot accommodate the full number of talented applicants who apply each year.

Due to the high volume of applications, the M.S. Review Committee cannot provide feedback regarding individual applications or the reasons for unsuccessful applications. An unsuccessful application cannot be reactivated, but you can reapply to the program by submitting a new online application for a future enrollment period. If you choose to do so, please resubmit supplemental materials to the Office of Graduate Student Affairs.

The time and effort you spent in preparing your application and the interest you have demonstrated is very much appreciated. The Committee wishes you success in your future educational and professional endeavors.

We thank you for your interest in our department.

Best regards,
