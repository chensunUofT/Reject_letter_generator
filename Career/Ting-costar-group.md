I apologize for the delay in my response. We enjoyed meeting you at Duke as well and are glad you enjoyed it. This was a tough decision, but we have decided to move forward with other candidates for the open positions at CoStar Group. I would love to stay in touch in case anything changes in the future or other opportunities arise.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any questions and best of luck to you as you finish out this semester.

Thank you,
